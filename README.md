Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a widely used business analytics technique that helps organizations understand customer behavior and improve marketing effectiveness.

In this project, K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is applied to segment customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to identify meaningful customer groups that help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve decision-making.

Problem Statement

Retail and e-commerce businesses often treat all customers similarly, which leads to:

Inefficient marketing spending

Lower customer engagement

Difficulty identifying high-value customers

This project aims to solve this problem by grouping customers into clusters based on purchasing behavior.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral information.

Features included:

Customer ID – Unique identifier

Gender – Customer gender

Age – Age of the customer

Annual Income (k$) – Yearly income

Spending Score (1–100) – Purchasing behavior score

Features used for clustering:

Annual Income

Spending Score

Project Workflow

The project follows a structured data science workflow:

Data loading and inspection

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Determining optimal clusters using the Elbow Method

Applying K-Means clustering

Visualization of customer segments

Business insights generation

Model Used

K-Means Clustering

Reasons for selecting K-Means:

Efficient and scalable

Easy to interpret

Suitable for behavioral segmentation

Fast convergence

Results and Insights

The model identified distinct customer segments such as:

High income – High spending (Premium customers)

High income – Low spending (Potential customers)

Low income – High spending (Impulse buyers)

Low income – Low spending (Low engagement group)

Moderate income – Moderate spending (Average customers)

These insights help businesses improve targeting, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Business Impact

Customer segmentation enables businesses to better understand customer behavior and design targeted marketing campaigns. Instead of using generic strategies, companies can focus on specific customer groups, increasing conversion rates and reducing marketing costs.

Segmentation also improves decision-making by helping businesses identify high-value customers, optimize inventory planning, and personalize customer experiences. Over time, this leads to higher customer retention, improved profitability, and stronger business growth.
